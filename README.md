# Mike's Balls - A simple game made in Java

This game was made during my first weeks on Academia de CÃ³digo, a code bootcamp based in Lisbon, Portugal.
It was made with the "tools" I had available to me at that moment, so don't expect it to be a fricking badass game.

## If you want to play this game

First of all, checkout playable branch and run the ant build file.

## How to play

The main objective is to "eat" all the balls smaller than you, while avoiding bigger balls.

Use left and right arrows to select a game type, and use space to start it.

You're the black ball, and to move it use the mouse to change it's direction.

Have Fun!
